Title
  # Healthcare SQL Analytics Portfolio

Description: 
This project demonstrates my SQL skills applied to synthetic healthcare data (Synthea). 
It analyzes patients, encounters, conditions, and immunizations to extract meaningful healthcare insights.

## Project Structure

**Database:** PostgreSQL  
**Editor/Tool:** pgAdmin 4 

healthcare-sql-analytics

- patients             # SQL queries and CSV outputs related to patients
- encounters           # SQL queries and CSV outputs related to encounters
- conditions           # SQL queries and CSV outputs related to conditions
- immunizations        # SQL queries and CSV outputs related to immunizations
- multi_join_tables    # Combined queries and outputs across multiple tables
- README.md            # Project documentation

## Key SQL Queries

- Average number of encounters per patient
- Age of patients at first diabetes diagnosis
- Patients who have both diabetes and hypertension
- Encounters within 7 days after immunization
- Top 5 most common conditions during immunization encounters
- Immunizations given during diabetes-related encounters
- Number patients per each age group

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Load the [100 Sample Synthetic Patient Records, CSV: 7 MB](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads) into PostgreSQL.
3. Run queries from the .sql files.
4. Explore results in the .csv files.

## Future Work

- Learn **Tableau** to create visualizations and dashboards for the SQL query results.  
- Build interactive charts and dashboards to better explore patient demographics, conditions, encounters, and immunizations.  
- Enhance the project with visual insights to make it more attractive and easier to understand for healthcare data analysis.

## About Me

I am a foreign medical graduate transitioning into healthcare data analytics. 
I combine clinical knowledge with SQL and Python skills to extract insights from healthcare data.
